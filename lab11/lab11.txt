Exercise 11.1
a. Compare and contrast your development and production deployments and explain how each is designed.

A development environment, as expected, makes development easier. This means features like hot reloading and a local server. Production on the other hand, utilizes
plugins like OccurenceOrderPlugin and UglifyJsPlugin which properly condense code for a more appropriate production product. The server does not live in the local
machine for production.

b. List the optimizations youâ€™ve configured for this production version and, if possible, find evidence of then in the deployed application files.

OccurenceOrderPlugin, UglifyJsPlugin, ExtractTextPlugin, and autoprefixer where added as optimizations for the production bundle. The only obvious optimization
that I can see in the bundle is the UglifyJsPlugin since all the JavaScript is unreadable.

Exercise 11.2
a. What advantage is there is deploying an application to a PaaS tool like Heroku?

The obvious benefit is that the free option allows you to test your app in production. Another benefit is that you can offload all the server optimizations of to
the PaaS, the server performance is no longer your responsibility and you can get the performance you need as long as you have enough money. This also comes with
downfalls since you now rely on Heroku to be consistent with their service.

b. How does Heroku know how to install and run your application (after pulling it from the specified branch on GitHub)?

They have a configured a Node environment that runs the default npm scripts such as build.
