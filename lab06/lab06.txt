a. Chrome - HTTP GET is the only accessible method
curl - all HTTP methods can be handled with curl
Using curl, I successfully used
  -POST
  -PUT
  -GET
  -DELETE
  -HEAD - did not follow the format of the given command format

b. HTTP 501 - Not Implemented is the most appropriate since the requests are not handled
