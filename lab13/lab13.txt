a. What benefit did using the React Router bring to the application?

React Router allows our application to simulate having different webpages accessible by URLs.

b. Which is better, hash history or browser history?

Hash history is an older work-around for legacy browsers that didn't support the HTML5 history API; it uses hashes in the URL to properly track history.
Browser history is the standard implementation of history that accesses the browsers history through an API, allowing for cleaner URLs.

c. Why does the server (either Webpack Dev Server or the Express server) have to be modified to support the browser history? Compare this with the hash-based server demonstrated in class, which didn't require such modifications.

The server is configured to only serve the package on the root URL: '/'. However, if a user try to refresh the page when any route, the GET request to the server will not be resolved.
To fix this issue, a wildcard is used to catch another other GET requests and simply serves up the static files again.
